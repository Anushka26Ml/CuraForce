# Problem Statement
In many Indian hospitals, emergency wards face overcrowding. Patients with minor issues and those with life-threatening conditions often wait in the same queue, causing delays for critical cases.
There is no simple pre-screening system to identify urgent patients early, and manual paperwork further slows down care.
# Proposed Solution
*Patient-First-Aid-Priority-App* is a Salesforce-based system that:
-  Lets patients or hospital staff log symptoms quickly through a custom Lightning Web Component (LWC).
- Calculates an urgency score and classifies cases as Low, Medium, or High.
- Automatically routes urgent cases to the right clinician using Flows.
- Triggers instant alerts and tasks for High-priority patients.
- Uses Agentforce AI to generate clinical notes and assist doctors with quick insights.
- Provides reports and dashboards to track emergency workloads and SLA compliance

# 2. Business Process Mapping

Step-by-step process flow:

- 1) Patient or staff logs symptoms via LWC intake form.
- 2) System calculates urgency score and identifies the relevant department (Gynecology, Cardiology, Orthopedics, General, Emergency, etc.).
- 3.  A Patient Case record is created in Salesforce with fields: Urgency Level + Department.
- 4.  Flow automation routes the case to the correct department queue/doctor.
- 5.  Urgent cases still trigger instant notifications + tasks.
- 6.  Clinician in that department reviews the case and (optionally) uses Agentforce AI to auto-generate a clinical note.
- 7.  Hospital Management tracks case distribution and SLA compliance via reports & dashboards.
