# Problem Statement
In many Indian hospitals, emergency wards face overcrowding. Patients with minor issues and those with life-threatening conditions often wait in the same queue, causing delays for critical cases.
There is no simple pre-screening system to identify urgent patients early, and manual paperwork further slows down care.
# Proposed Solution
*Patient-First-Aid-Priority-App* is a Salesforce-based system that:
-  Lets patients or hospital staff log symptoms quickly through a custom Lightning Web Component (LWC).
- Calculates an urgency score and classifies cases as Low, Medium, or High.
- Automatically routes urgent cases to the right clinician using Flows.
- Triggers instant alerts and tasks for High-priority patients.
- Uses Agentforce AI to generate clinical notes and assist doctors with quick insights.
- Provides reports and dashboards to track emergency workloads and SLA compliance

# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.
